## Conclusions

⚠ **Model requires further tuning** (Dice < 0.5)

⚠ **Potential overfitting detected** - validation loss significantly higher than training loss


### Next Steps

1. **Visualization Analysis:** Review output visualizations to understand model predictions qualitatively
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Consider adjusting learning rate, batch size, or model capacity if needed
3. **Extended Training:** Train for more iterations if loss is still decreasing
4. **Dataset Expansion:** Include more training data if available
5. **Cross-validation:** Test on other medical imaging datasets for generalization
